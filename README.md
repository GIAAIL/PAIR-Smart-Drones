# PAIR Smart Drones

DIL (Design Informatics Lab) joined the Smart Drones research group of the NCTU PAIR Labs. Our primary goals of research are two-fold:

* Human-Computer Interaction (HCI): Interactions between pilot and drone, M2M communications.
* Spatial Informatics: Drone-asisted environmental sensing, social IoT.

## Scene Models for VR/AirSim

There are few types of models in the list.
* Merged high-poly models are mostly captured by drone and modeled by Altizure.
* Hand-crafted low-poly models are mostly modeled in SketchUp or Rhino by measuring.
